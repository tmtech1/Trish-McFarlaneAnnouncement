      <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<br>
  
        <p> The mysterious and charismatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin (Mr. Mortensen) is a driver for one of London's most notorious organized crime families of Eastern European origin. 
<br><br> 
        The family itself is part of the Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood. Headed by Semyon (Academy Award nominee Armin Mueller-Stahl), whose courtly charm as the welcoming proprietor of the plush Trans-Siberian restaurant impeccably masks a cold and brutal core, the family's fortunes are tested by Semyon's volatile son and enforcer Kirill (Vincent Cassel), who is more tightly bound to Nikolai than to his own father.
<br><br> 
However, Nikolai's carefully maintained existence is jarred once he crosses paths at Christmastime with Anna Khitrova (Academy Award nominee Naomi Watts), a midwife at a North London hospital. Anna is deeply affected by the desperate situation of a young teenager who dies while giving birth to a baby. Anna resolves to try to trace the baby's lineage and relatives. The girl's personal diary also survives her; it is written in Russian, and Anna seeks answers in it.
<br><br> 
Anna's mother Helen (Sin&eacute;ad Cusack) does not discourage her, but Anna's skeptical Russian-born uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) urges caution. He is right to do so; by delving into the diary, Anna has accidentally unleashed the full fury of the Vory.
<br><br> 
With Semyon and Kirill closing ranks and Anna pressing her inquiries, Nikolai unexpectedly finds his loyalties divided. The family tightens its grip on him; who can, or should, he trust? Several lives, including his own, hang in the balance as a harrowing chain of murder, deceit, and retribution reverberates through the darkest corners of both the family and London itself.
<br><br> 
Eastern Promises features the reteaming of acclaimed director David Cronenberg with his "A History of Violence" leading man Viggo Mortensen is written by Steve Knight (Academy Award-nominated screenwriter of "Dirty Pretty Things").
<br><br> 
In this thriller director and star together explore the psyche, physicality, and fortunes of a man whose true nature may never be wholly revealed.

      <h1>TRIVIA</h1>
      <br>
<div class="divtrivia">
        <ul>
          
          <li> One day after shooting, Viggo Mortensen went to a pub without washing off his tattoos or even changing out of his costume. He claims that some of the patrons became very frightened of him, assuming he was a real member of Vory v Zakone. </li>

          <br><br>

<li> None of the characters who were members of the Vory v Zakone used a gun throughout the movie. The reason for this is that when doing research on Russian organized crime, David Cronenberg discovered that members of the Vory v Zakone typically prefer to use knives instead of guns. The rationale for this is that if Vory v Zakone members were arrested by police and questioned as to why they were in possession of such weapons, the suspects could evade suspicion by claiming that the knives were simply for linoleum cutting.</li>
<br><br>

<li>The nine actors in the Fellowship in Lord of the Rings all got tattoos that said "the nine" in elvish. Even though they promised not to show them on camera, Viggo Mortensen's elvish tattoo is visible on his left shoulder in the scenes where he has no shirt.</li>
<br><br>

<li>For the bathhouse fight scene, the scene was choreographed with the actors instead of stuntmen. The actors had to train in specific fighting styles chosen for their characters and it took two days to shoot on location in London. According to the DVD commentary, both Mortensen and Cronenberg agreed that Nikolai had to fight his would-be killers completely nude.</li>
<br><br>

<li>The scene where Semyon demonstrates his musical skills to the little girls was not dubbed. Armin Mueller-Stahl does play the violin in real life, and was a noted concert violinist in his youth.</li>
<br><br>

<li>The tattoos around Nikolai's (Viggo Mortensen) ankles read "Where are you going?" and "What the fuck do you care?" in Russian. Mortensen thought that they were hilarious, that 'one foot doesn't respect the other.'</li>
<br><br> 

<li>Naomi Watts discovered she was pregnant with her son Alexander two weeks into shooting this movie. She initially tried to hide it, but costume designer Denise Cronenbergfound out about it.</li>
<br><br>

<li>The full name of Viggo Mortensen's character is Nikolai Luzhin. This is a reference to Vladimir Nabokov's novel "The Luzhin Defense".</li>
<br><br> 


<li>The film, shot in England, marked the first time director David Cronenberg shot a movie entirely outside of Canada.</li>
<br><br> 

<li>Naomi Watts spent time at the Whittington Hospital for the role as a midwife.</li>
<br><br> 
<li>To prepare for his role, Viggo Mortensen traveled alone to Moscow, St. Petersburg and the Ural Mountain region of Siberia, where he spent five days driving around without a translator. He read books on the gangs of the Vory v Zakone (thieves in law), Russian prison culture and the importance of prison tattoos as criminal resum&eacute;s, and perfected his character's Siberian accent and learned lines in Russian, Ukrainian and English. During filming, he used worry beads made in prison from melted-down plastic cigarette lighters and decorated his trailer with copies of Russian icons.</li>
<br><br>

<li>A sequel was planned but never materialized.</li>
<br><br> 

<li>Jerzy Skolimowski's character claims to be an ex-KGB agent. In White Nights (1985), he played one.</li>
<br><br> 
<li>About five cast and crew personnel worked on both Eastern Promises (2007) and the filmed adaptation of John le Carr&eacute;'s novel, Our Kind of Traitor (2016), the two pictures being made and released around nine years apart, and both featuring story-lines involving the Russian Mafia. They were actor James Payton who was a stand-in for both Ewan McGregor and Viggo Mortensen in Our Kind of Traitor (2016) and Eastern Promises (2007) respectively; fight and stunt co-ordinator Julian Spencer; art director / chief draughtsman Dean Clegg; ADR mixer / recordist Mark Appleby; and production coordinator Jo Wallett.</li>

      <h1>CLOSEUP:Russian Criminal Tattoo Art</h1>

<br>
        <p>
          The most startling image in David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises occurs about half way through the movie when Viggo Mortensen takes off his clothes. And no, the warrior Aragon hasn't done a Raging Bull and gone to seed for his role as an unassuming Russian chauffeur to a London crime boss. Mortensen's physique is intact but it's what's on top of it that shocks. Covering his torso is a rippling tapestry of iconographic tattoos, a collage of faces, symbols, dates and other information that totals, as Cronenberg explains, the character's "passport" through the Russian penal system.
<br><br> 
The scene takes place in the backroom of a London restaurant. Ready to advance up the ladder of the local Russian mob organization, Mortensen's character, Nikolai, demonstrates his fealty to thug life by showing his bosses the body art that can only be earned by having lived the life of a hardcore criminal.
<br><br> 
The scene just another example of unbridled creativity from a director, who, after all, once imagined a future in which a VHS player might be located in one's abdomen?

No, says filmmaker Alix Lambert, whose documentary Mark of Cain is a definitive look into the symbolism of Russian prison tattoo art. "You would learn everything about a Russian prisoner" by scrutinizing their tattoos, she says. "What prisons they sat in, what crimes they committed, what position they held in prison, and what their personal proclivities were. Under the thieves' code, if you are a high-ranking prisoner, you want those tattoos, they would afford you a higher status."
<br><br> 
While tattoos are common in gang and criminal life across the world, the symbolism of Russian criminal tattoos is particularly highly developed, says Lambert. "We have prison tattoos here, gang tattoos, but there are 40 tattoos, tops," she notes. "Russian prisons have entire dictionaries of tattoos. It's an incredibly detailed, rapidly evolving language."
<br><br> 
Prior to the filming of Eastern Promises, Mortensen discovered Lambert's documentary, a short version of which had screened on ABC's Nightline, and showed it to Cronenberg, who was inspired to elevate the importance of the tattoo storyline in the script. "The scene where Nikolai is inducted into the mob became a scene of reading and commenting on tattoos and their meanings," Cronenberg remarks.
<br><br> 
Eastern Promises key makeup artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDMdWPccrmQ">Stephan Depuis</a> was charged with overseeing the authenticity of the film's foray into tattoo culture. He hired the London-based effects makeup specialist <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2894254/">David Stoneman</a> and his partner Helen Morley, who were given two weeks to produce the temporary tattoos that would be applied to Mortensen. 
<br><br> 
Using as reference material Danzig Baldaev's Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopedia, Stoneman drew the designs by hand and then digitally scanned them into the Photoshop software program to create four separate color layers for the silkscreen printing process. "This was very time consuming,and meant working long days and quite a few all-nighters", Stoneman says.
<br><br> 
"The tattoos are basically a sandwich of an ultra-fine top or carrier coat, that holds all the pigment in place; a design layer made up of skin-safe four-color process colors; and then the adhesive layer," Stoneman continues. "This is all attached to a very absorbent layer called 'transfer release paper.' When ready to use the tattoos are trimmed around the edges and the design is placed paper side up onto the skin. The back of the paper is wetted for ten seconds, and the whole design is transferred onto the skin. A wet sponge is then pressed directly onto the tattoo to force the design onto the skin. Once dry this gives the tattoo much more realism; it gives the appearance that the tattoo is in the skin and not sitting on the surface."
<br><br> 
Stoneman's work is convincing both on screen and within the film's storyline, the authenticity of Nikolai's body art succeeds in moving the chauffeur up the criminal ranks. But, as Lambert details in Mark of Cain, in the real world the culture of Russian prison tattoos is rapidly fading. Her film, which uses its study of body art to delve into a whole range of cultural, behavioral and public policy issues, evokes a fin de siecle era of Eastern bloc criminality, a time in which crime, criminals and the art of tattooing are not what they used to be.
<br><br> 
Largely shot in Russian prisons in the towns of Perm and Samara, Mark of Cain begins by depicting the Russian prison system as a Theater of the Absurd in which the social codes of everyday society are violently exaggerated. "Downcast," or submissive, prisoners are forcibly tattooed with the word "slave." High-ranking prisoners, meanwhile, are guaranteed a good night's sleep in the monstrously overcrowded cells by the words "don't wake me up" they are privileged to have tattooed on their eyelids.
<br><br> 
As the film progresses, the meanings Lambert extracts from the tattoos, which are drawn by prisoners on each other with homemade ink guns pumping a mixture of soot and urine, begin to change. For prisoners the tattoos are powerful statements of identity, but one Russian critic of the penal system claims they are actually a deliberate method of social control. They have the effect, he argues, of spreading a drug-resistant form of TB engineered to suppress the prison population.
<br><br> 
 A new generation of criminals do not recognize or respect the potent history behind these inked images. "There's a division between the older prisoners and the younger 'new money' ones," Lambert says. "A prisoner used to say, 'I want this tattoo' but it was something he had earned." She discusses a younger prisoner who asked for a tattoo of a heart pierced by a knife. "He didn't realize that it meant that he was a hired killer, so he wound up burning it off. The alternative would have meant actually becoming a hired killer, and that's too demanding. And a lot of new criminals aren't even getting tattoos, they might want to go to university after prison." By the film's end, the tattoos' original, complex iconography is, like many things in the new, post-Soviet era, in danger of extinction.
